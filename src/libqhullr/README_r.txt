Converting libqhull to libqhullr

==========================
Todo 

After qmake, need to update HEADER paths for libqhull, libqhullr, libqhullcpp libqhullpcpp
    Path="..\lib
    Path="..\..\src\lib

Remove user_eg7,8,9

Rename qhull_ra.h to qhull_ar.h


---
Convert qhulltest.cpp to libqhullcpp and branch old code
At initialization, check for compatible libqhull.  Add a version check to libqhull

Convert testqset.c to testqset_r.c
   Try to make qhT and mem_r.c etc. plugable
Convert user_eg to qhull_r.dll
Convert user_eg2 to libqhullstatic_r.a
Convert user_eg3 to libqhullcpp
Rework user_eg7.cpp,etc for new names, add to README


---
3>..\..\src\qhullr\unix_r.c(39) : warning C4273: '_isatty' : inconsistent dll linkage
3>        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\INCLUDE\io.h(209) : see previous definition of '_isatty'

---
Redo usage note for qhullr.cpp

---
/*** uncomment here and qhull_a.h
     if string.h does not define memcpy()
#include <memory.h>
*/

---
Run through valgrind

---
Fix or "sample code" in user_r.h

and in user_r.c
  qh_call_qhull(qh, void )
    template for calling qhull from inside your program

--
Try with and without qh_NOmem

--
Update 
  README.txt -- the new subprojects
  CMakeLists.txt
  
==============
Steps to update C code to reentrant qhull (e.g., testqset_r.c, user_eg*.c)

Branch the code to ..._r.c

Rename include files
#include "qhull_ar.h"

Allocate qh at the top, and remove other references to qh_qh and qh_qhPOINTER
  qhT qh_qh;
  qhT *qh= &qh_qh;

If needed, remove spaces between name and argument list
  {[^a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*} \(
  \1(
  
Make the following regexp substitions [DevStudio use {} for grouping instead of ()]

  Prefix function declarations with "(qhT *qh, "
  ^{[a-zA-Z0-9]* [a-zA-Z0-9]*\}(
  \1(qhT *qh, 

  'qh' is the first argument for most internal calls and qhull calls
  \({[a-zA-Z0-9_]*, }
  (qh, \1
  
  \({[a-zA-Z0-9_]+}\)
  (qh, \1)
  
  \(\)
  (qh)

  'qh '
  'qh->'
  
Other substitions to consider

  ("
  (qh, "
  
  (&
  (qh, &
  
  ()
  (qh)

Review the code for obvious errors
Remove qhT for functions that do not need it

Make the following substitions to correct mistakes made above
  qh, qh,
  qh, 

  qh, void
  qh
Review the code for routines that do not take qh

Compile and fix the errors

==============
Steps

Build qhullr.sln from qhull_all.sln
  Shadow build isn't working for header files. libbqhull and libqhullr
   RelativePath="..\..\src\libqhull\
  Doesn't create qhullstatic_rd.lib
  Inconsistent dll linkage for _isatty
  
  include only libqhullstaticr and qhullr
  remove libqhull, libqhullp, libqhullr to avoid double searches
  remove all but testqset from testqset
  
Replace all include files with _r.h

[qhull_all] Remove all spaces before the parens 'qh_... (...)' 
[qhull_all] Change copyright to 2014

Checked in source

Check for access to .c and .h files

Add qhmemT *qh before all routines
   # Routines with arguments, 3648+498 occurrences
   {qh_[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[^_]\(}{[^)/]}
   \1qhmemT *qh, \2

   # Routines with comment args, 15+ occurrences

Removed rboxT from rboxlib_r.c

1138 errors and 438 warnings.

Remove dependency on libqhull_r for statT
Convert FOREACHsetelement_i_ in libqhull_r.h 
traceN needs qh for qh_fprintf
add qh to () calls

Down to 600 errors

Reorganized projects for cpp. 

Fixed up qhull_p-exports.def.  qhull_r-exports.def has no DATA records.

user_eg3 with libqhullpcpp worked correctly the first time
