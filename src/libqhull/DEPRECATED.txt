qhull/src/libqhull

    This directory contains the deprecated qh_qh global configuration of qhull
    
    It will be maintained at least until January 2015.
    
    Except for qhull, the qhull executables will continue to build with libqhull.
    
    See qhull/src/libqhullr for the reentrant version of qhull.  On modern
    architectures, it is as fast or faster than the global configuration.
